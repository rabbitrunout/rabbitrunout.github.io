In the design, I used a grid and Photoshop guides to align blocks and maintain balance between product photography and informational sections. Key elements were developed: navigation menu, product block, product cards, and branded footer. Special attention was paid to the combination of photos and color fills to emphasize the “naturalness” and modern style of the brand.\n\nThe mockup features:\n\n- A hero section with product photography\n- Navigation (Home, Who We Are, Products, Recipes, Contact)\n- A section with brand messages and highlights (“Wild like a Nut?”)\n- Product cards with visual separation by color blocks",

  shortDesc: "First digital illustration project on a space theme",
  fullDesc: 
  "This was my very first independent project in illustration, created with zero prior experience in this field. The task was to design a bright and dynamic composition on a space theme. I worked with shapes, colors, and characters, ensuring every element matched the overall concept. Despite being a beginner, I managed to accurately capture details such as planets, a rocket with an astronaut, a telescope, and an alien character. The illustration reflects attention to balance, composition, and precision of elements.\n\nKey highlights:\n\n- A rocket flying into space with an astronaut\n- Planets, stars, and comets forming a cosmic background\n- A telescope on Earth pointing into space\n- A cartoon-style alien character adding a playful accent\n- Bold typography for the title “Space, The Final Frontier”\n\nThe main achievement of this project is that, even without prior practice in illustration, the result turned out clean, with sharp lines, a vibrant palette, and a complete visual style.",
